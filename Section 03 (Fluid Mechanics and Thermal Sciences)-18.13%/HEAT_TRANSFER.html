      <td>The Fourier Number is a dimensionless quantity used in transient heat conduction analysis. It represents the ratio of the rate of heat conduction within a material to the rate of thermal energy storage in the material. It is defined as the product of thermal diffusivity and time, divided by the square of the characteristic length scale. The Fourier number describes how quickly temperature changes propagate through a solid material during transient heat conduction.</td>

It compares the resistance to heat transfer within the object (conduction) to the resistance to heat transfer at the surface (convection). It is defined as the product of convective heat transfer coefficient and characteristic length scale, divided by the thermal conductivity of the object. The Biot number helps determine whether conduction or convection dominates the heat transfer process. A high Biot number indicates that convection plays a significant role, while a low Biot number suggests that conduction is dominant.</td>

This assumption allows the object to be treated as a single lumped parameter with a uniform temperature.</td>
