      <td>Event Flow Scheduling Techniques</td>
      <td>Event flow scheduling techniques involve analyzing the flow of events and their dependencies to determine the order of executing tasks. These techniques optimize the project schedule based on logical event relationships.</td>
      <td>In event flow scheduling, tasks are scheduled based on the occurrence of events. For instance, in a software development project, the event of completing the requirements gathering phase can trigger the start of the design phase, followed by development, testing, and deployment.</td>

      <td>Critical Ratio Scheduling</td>
      <td>Critical ratio scheduling establishes priorities among jobs based on their criticality. The critical ratio is calculated by dividing the time remaining to the deadline by the time required to complete the job. Jobs with higher critical ratios are given higher priority.</td>
      <td>Suppose you have multiple tasks to complete within a project, each with its own deadline and estimated completion time. Using critical ratio scheduling, you calculate the critical ratio for each task by dividing the time remaining until the deadline by the estimated completion time. Tasks with higher critical ratios are prioritized for timely delivery.</td>

      <td>Slotting Technique for Scheduling</td>
      <td>The slotting technique for scheduling divides the available time into fixed slots and assigns tasks based on requirements and priorities. This technique optimizes resource allocation and time management.</td>
      <td>Let's consider a manufacturing plant that produces multiple products. The slotting technique can be used to schedule production runs for each product within specific time slots. The scheduling decision is based on factors such as product demand, production capacity, and resource availability. Each product is assigned a specific slot, ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting production targets.</td>

      <td>Short Internal Scheduling</td>
      <td>Short internal scheduling prioritizes jobs based on their internal characteristics, such as processing time or complexity, to minimize the overall completion time. It optimizes the order of execution based on internal properties.</td>
      <td>In a data processing task with jobs of varying processing times, short internal scheduling prioritizes jobs based on their processing time. Shorter jobs are given higher priority to minimize the overall completion time of the entire task.</td>

      <td>Time-series Models</td>
      <td>Time-series models are used for forecasting future values based on historical data points collected at regular time intervals. These models aim to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data to make predictions. Regression analysis can be applied within time-series models to understand the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables.</td>
      <td>Suppose you have monthly sales data for a retail store over the past few years. By using regression analysis within a time-series model, you can examine how the sales are affected by variables such as time, promotions, and economic indicators. This analysis allows you to forecast future sales based on the identified patterns and trends in the historical data.</td>

      <td>Delphi Model</td>
      <td>The Delphi model is a forecasting technique that involves gathering opinions from a panel of experts to make predictions or reach a consensus. Regression analysis may be employed within the Delphi model to analyze the relationships between variables suggested by the experts and make forecasts based on the aggregated expert opinions.</td>
      <td>Imagine a scenario where a group of industry experts is asked to provide their forecasts for the future demand of a specific product. Regression analysis can be used within the Delphi model to analyze the relationship between various factors suggested by the experts and the predicted demand. This helps identify the most influential variables and provide a more accurate forecast by combining the opinions of the experts.</td>

      <td>Causal Models</td>
      <td>Causal models aim to identify cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Regression analysis is commonly used within causal models to quantify the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable and establish the strength of the relationship.</td>
      <td>Suppose you want to forecast the sales of a product based on factors such as price, advertising expenditure, and competitor activity. Regression analysis can be used within a causal model to estimate how changes in these independent variables impact the sales. By adjusting the values of the independent variables and observing their impact on the dependent variable, you can make forecasts.</td>
